# Custom Enterprise Application with CRUD, IoT, VLM+RAG functionality

## Summary

This is a multi-service enterprise application with three main components:
- **Files API**: Document processing with VLM (Vision Language Model) and RAG capabilities
- **IoT Management**: Gateway and device management with event sourcing
- **Frontend Clients**: React/Next.js applications for user interfaces
- **Infrastructure/Deployment**: AWS-based deployment management for scalable application hosting

### Component-Based Architecture

The application is organized into distinct components for clean separation of concerns:

```

│   ├── routers/        # API endpoints (files, invoices, health)
│   ├── services/       # Business logic and database services
│   ├── adapters/       # Storage and queue abstractions
│   ├── s3/             # S3 operations (read, write, delete, event notifications)
│   └── schemas.py      # Data models and validation
│
├── vlm_workers/        # 🤖 Worker Component (ECS-Ready)
│   ├── models/         # VLM model management and loaders
│   ├── processing/     # Invoice parsing and document processing
│   ├── gpu/            # GPU configuration for model inference

│   ├── gateway/        # Go-based IoT gateway service
│   ├── rules_engine/   # Go-based rules processing engine
│   └── mosquitto/      # MQTT broker configuration
│
├── database/           # 💾 Shared Database Layer
│   ├── local.py        # Local SQLite database operations
│   ├── sqlite_http_adapter.py  # HTTP adapter for remote SQLite on EC2
│   ├── event_store.py  # Event sourcing implementation
│   └── indexes.py      # Database indexing utilities
│
└── deployment/         # 🏗️ Infrastructure Component
    ├── aws/            # AWS infrastructure (Lambda, ECS, EC2, API Gateway, etc.)
    ├── docker/         # Container definitions and compose files
    └── kubernetes/     # Kubernetes manifests
```
